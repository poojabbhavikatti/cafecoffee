        <h2>Cappuccino</h2>
        <p>
            Cappuccino can be traced back to Italian coffee houses in the 17th century, where it first gained popularity. <br><br>
            Although the exact origins of cappuccino are somewhat disputed, it is believed to have evolved from the Viennese coffee houses in Austria. <br><br> 
            These establishments were known for serving coffee with cream, which later inspired the Italians to create their own version of this creamy caffeinated delight. <br><br>
            The name <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-34100569">“cappuccino” comes from the Capuchin friars</a> in the 19th century, whose robes resembled the coffee’s color. It wasn’t until the 20th century that cappuccino made its way into the modern coffee culture, becoming a favorite among coffee drinkers around the world. <br><br>
            The cappuccino’s origins are intertwined with the rich history of Austrian coffee houses and the <a href="https://caffestreets.com/kapuziner-the-original-cappuccino/">Kapuziner</a>, a precursor to this beloved coffee drink.
