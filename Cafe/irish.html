        <h2>Irish</h2>
        <p>
            Irish Coffee is one of the most beloved drinks in the history of Irish culture, with a warm and inviting flavor that’s sure to please even the pickiest of tastebuds. <br><br>
            Irish Coffee first occurs in written record on November 10th, 1952, when the New York Times reported on a new “special to Ireland” – Irish Coffee. <br><br>
            The article reads, “At Shannon Airport outside Limerick, passengers in the jet taxi of a parked Aer Lingus aircraft are served with a new Shannon Airport Special – Irish Coffee.” <br><br>
            So, it appears as though Irish Coffee as we know it today first appeared as a way to liven up the dullness of an airport. <br><br>
            Irish Coffee spread rapidly across the globe, becoming a mainstay of airline travel, restaurants, and taverns. <br><br>
            As the saying goes, <a href="https://guptajiteacentre.com/irish-coffee-5-health-benefits/">“an Irish Coffee a day keeps the doctor away!”</a>
