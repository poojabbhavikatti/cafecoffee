        <h2>Mocha</h2>
        <p>
            Also known as “mocaccino”, “mochaccino”, or “mochachino”, mocha coffee is an espresso-based beverage that’s unique from others such as latte, cappuccino, and macchiato, due to the presence of chocolate notes. <br><br>
            Ironically, the origin of the word “mocha” doesn’t have anything to do with chocolate or coffee and chocolate combos. <br><br>
            It actually refers to a variety of coffee beans that were grown in the central mountains of Yemen, then shipped from the port of Al Mokha (Mocha). <br><br>
            Mocha refers to any mixture of coffee with chocolate flavoring, even as simple as some hot chocolate with shots of espresso blended together. <br><br>
            A <a href="https://bigcupofcoffee.com/how-to-make-caffe-mocha-recipe/">caffé mocha</a> is basically a chocolate-flavored variant of a caffé latte so it’s also based on espresso and hot milk. <br><br>
            The difference is that a mocha contains chocolate flavoring and sweetener.
